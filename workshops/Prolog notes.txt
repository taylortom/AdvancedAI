Notes on the Prolog Refresher & application to V-World

This first workshop is intended to 'get you ready' for the exploration of Donald Nute's V-World (Game). In preparation, you should make yourself familiar with the location of the V-World Folder on the P-Drive, and its directory structure, i.e. what is there. This is a summary:

The path (currently) for this is:

P:\COURSEWK\CI342\V-World

I recommend that you copy this entire folder to whatever personal storage medium you like. It is important for you to be able to make your own changes/ new files, etc. so your own copy could be invaluable. Note: I have made certain modifications from Donald Nute's original. The version downloadable from his site will not work.

Notice that there are a large number of files in this folder. They are:

Executable (.exe): This is (obviously) an executable version. It is of no real use to us, but it is necessary to have because some icons are stored in it (for some reason!)

Overlay (.ovl): This is to go with the executable - of no use to us, but if you were to run the executable, this would be needed ( a cut down version of the Prolog Kernel)

Prolog files (.pl): Usual Prolog files. These are:
a. vworld.pl ... the main world
b. mapmaker.pl ... a utility  to design levels (a level editor)
c. search.pl ... a program to experiment with search algorithms
World files (.vw): These are actually just Prolog files with a changed suffix (so that they can show up in the dedicated 'Open' box for loadiing worlds. There are a number of these. Note. They cannot be saved as normal in this format. They must be Exported.

Agent Files (.agt): Again, these are just Prolog files renamed for the same reasons as world files. Same restrictions apply to saving these files.

Please make sure you are familiar with this flat structure. You will become more familiar as the workshop/ workshop time proceeds.
